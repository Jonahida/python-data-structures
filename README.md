# Data Structures in Python

This repository provides Python implementations of essential data structures. These structures are crucial for efficient problem-solving and serve as the foundation for numerous algorithms. The interactive main program allows users to explore each data structure, perform operations, and learn how they work.

## Data Structures Implemented
1. **Stack** - Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure.
2. **Queue** - First In, First Out (FIFO) structure.
3. **Linked List** - A sequence of nodes, where each node links to the next.
4. **Hash Table** - Key-value storage for fast lookups.
5. **Binary Tree** - A hierarchical structure with nodes, each having at most two children.
6. **Trie** - A tree-based data structure for storing strings, optimized for prefix searches.
7. **Graph** - A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes.

## How to Use

To interactively explore and perform operations on the different data structures, simply run the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

### In the program, you will be able to:
1. **Select a data structure** from the list.
2. **Explore common operations**, such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and search, for the selected structure.
3. **Learn about real-world examples** where each structure is useful.

### Example Operations:

- **Stack**: Push, pop, and peek elements.  
  **Example use**: Undo/Redo actions in applications.

- **Queue**: Enqueue, dequeue, and peek elements.  
  **Example use**: Task scheduling, or breadth-first search (BFS) in graph traversal.

- **Linked List**: Insert, delete, and traverse nodes.  
  **Example use**: Dynamic memory allocation or implementing stacks/queues.

- **Hash Table**: Insert, search, delete, and display key-value pairs.  
  **Example use**: Caching and database indexing.

- **Binary Tree**: Insert nodes, search for a value, and perform tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order).  
  **Example use**: Binary search trees (BST) for efficient searching and sorting.

- **Trie**: Insert strings, search for a string, and display the trie structure.  
  **Example use**: Autocomplete systems or efficient dictionary lookups.

- **Graph**: Add vertices, create edges, and perform graph operations (like DFS/BFS).  
  **Example use**: Social network modeling or route planning algorithms.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Running the Program
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jonahida/python-data-structures.git
cd python-data-structures
```

Run the main script to start exploring data structures:
```bash
python main.py
```
The program will prompt you to select a data structure and perform different operations on it.
